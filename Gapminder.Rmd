## Introduction

In this document, we will be exploring the Gapminder dataset.

## Observations of gapminder

### 1. Countries where life expectancy less than 30

```{r gapminder1, echo = FALSE}
life_lt_30 <- gapminder %>% filter(lifeExp < 30)
life_lt_30
```


Afghanistan and Rwanda are the only counties with life expectancy less than 30. Afganistan life expancy was *28.8* in 1952 and Rwanda was *23.6* years in 1992.

### Countries with life expecancy greater than 81

```{r gapminder2, echo = FALSE}
life_gt_81 <- gapminder %>% filter(lifeExp > 81)
life_gt_81
```

Five countries have life expectancy gt 81
* Australia
* Hong Kong
* Iceland
* Japan
* Switzerland

### Life expectancy by continent in 2007

```{r gapminder3, echo = TRUE}
cont_2007 <- gapminder %>% filter(year == 2007)
cont_2007
```
